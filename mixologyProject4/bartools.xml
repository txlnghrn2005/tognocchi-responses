			<tool_name>Corkscrew</tool_name>
			<description>Cork extractors come in many styles, but the secret to getting one that can really pull corks is to look for a coil and not a screw. The conventional screw-type cork-puller is not wide enough to get a good grip on a bad cork. The coil-type does a better job because it is distributed through the cork in a wider area. Look for one of four types: the sommelier's corkscrew, the gourmet or wing-type corkscrew, the double-action corkscrew, and the twistup corkscrew.</description>
