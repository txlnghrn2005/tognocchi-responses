			<tip_number>No. 1: Soda Gun</tip_number>
			<description>Beware the "soda gun" and how you use it. This invention is popular in big, busy bars, enabling bartenders to fill glasses with carbonated mixers at a machine-gun pace. The device consists of a battery of buttons and a pouring spout attachedto a long hose that leads to storage tanks under the bar. At the press of a button the soda-gun  (aka "arm", "snake") will dispense cola, lemon-lime soda, ginger-ale, club soda, or water. It's a handy, time-saving gadget, good for busy bartenders, not so good for unbusy customers. Some people complain that frequently the carbonation is not what it should be, meaning that their drinks are flat, not bubbly. The more serious problem is the mixing of flavors from the small amount of residue left from the last filling. Super-premium spirits selling at super-premium prices deserve the best mixer money can buy, which is why top bars use bottled mixers.</description>

			<tip_number>No. 2: Crystal Check </tip_number>
			<description>Clean, sparkling glassware adds to the appeal of any drink. But don't rely on either home or institutional dishwashers to give you spotless glasses every time. As every bartender knows, water spots are the problem, and, occasionally, grease smears from lipstick. Always check glasses that come from the dishwasher against the light to see if the detergent is doing its job. If glasses are hand-washed, use two towels: one for drying and one for polishing. Change towels frequently. From a hygenic standpoint, air-drying after wahing is best. If washing glasses in a home dishwasher, do not remove glasses after the final rinse cycle. Give them time to dry in the heat before removing.</description>

			<tip_number>No. 3: Martini Fixings</tip_number>
			<description>The conventional Martini employs traditional garnishes, the lemon peel and the green olive. The Gibson, an extra-dry Martini using tiny bottled pearl onions was considered to be a rather daring innovation. Nowadays, Martini makers and drinkers are experimenting with a wide range of garnishes with rewarding results. There is no end to creative garnishes. The classic Martini seems to be strong enough to stand up to anything in the way of additives. As every bartender knows, there is no accounting for individual taste.</description>

			<tip_number>No. 4: Cocktail Scents</tip_number>
			<description>Many mixed drinks are enhanced by garnishes such as lemon, lime, and orange peel as well as olives, cherries, and onions. Many Bartenders will twist a lemon peel (to release the essential oils) and rub it around the rim of a cocktail glass when making a Martini, for example. The lemony aroma and taste enhance the drink. Why not try t with lime, orange, and even an olive or maraschino cherry? The suggestion of flavor on the rim of the glass gives a hint of the enjoyment of a well-made cocktail that awaits the drinker.</description>

			<description>Having a big party at home? A convenient place to store all of the ice you’ll need, as well as bottled mixers and fruit juices that must be chilled, is your automatic dish washing machine. It will hold enough to serve an army. When the party’s over, just turn on the machine and wash the remaining ice away.</description>

			<tip_number>No. 6: Flavor Mist</tip_number>
			<description>A legendary Martini maker in a bar in Chicago’s Michigan Avenue famous for its generous, well-made Martinis delights In using a atomizer connected to a vermouth bottle to make very, very, very dry Martinis for the regulars. It not only works efficiently, but Martini devotes are tantalized by aroma of vermouth from the clouds of mist that are generated as each Martini is made at the bar. The atomizer may also be used effectively to “top” certain cocktails with aromatic spirits such as   Pernod, crème de menthe, kirsch, Cointreau, and even Angostura bitters. Apparently spraying certain highly scented liqueurs and brandies into the atmosphere increases the intensity of the aroma. It is also quite economical, for a little squirt of crème de violette or Drambuie seems to go a long way.</description>

			<tip_number>No. 7: Beer Care</tip_number>
			<description>Don’t over chill beer, it makes the beer look cloudy, suppresses the head, and interferes with the flavor. The 45-degree (F) range is just about right, give or take a few degrees. Ale and stout are best when served around 55 degrees because of their more complex flavors.  Bottled beer should be stored in a cool place and away from sunlight. If a bottle or can of beer has no fizz when poured into a glass, discard it. It may be spoiled. And never wash beer mugs or glasses in soup or water. It destroys the head. Instead, wash in a solution of salt or soda and air dry.</description>

			<tip_number>No. 8: Invisible Pepper</tip_number>
			<description>When making Bloody Mary’s or other drinks requiring pepper, perceptive bartenders, mindful that pinch of black pepper on the surface of a drink is about as appetizing as a used cigar, follow the custom of French chiefs, who for many years have used ground white pepper in cream soups, salad dressings, and light sauces. It is not only invisible to the casual observer, but blends better than grounded black pepper. The flavoring imparted is about the same.</description>

			<description>To freeze a bottle of vodka or akvavit a block office is not only a very fashionable way to serve these sprites crackling cold in pony glasses, to be quaffed neat with caviar or whatever else is being offered as an hors d’oeuvre, but it is a practical way of ensuring your spirits will be properly iced. One method is to cut the top off a half-gallon milk carton and fill with water and place a bottle of spirits in the center of the carton, place in freezing compartment standing vertically and fill with additional water until the carton is filled to the rim. After ice is frozen solid, remove carton and save for use in replacing ice meltage when the cake of ice is served at room temperature. Bottle may be stored in the carton in the freezer and additional water added for refreezing ice block as needed.</description>

			<tip_number>No. 10: Creative Containers</tip_number>
			<description>All kinds of glassware is used to make drinks look more appealing, important, and romantic. A big beer schooner or a king-size brandy snifter properly garnished with fruits and flowers has a certain allure that one does not feel when the same drink is served in a highball glass. It is not uusually necessary to shop around for rare and unusual glassware to achieve an exotic effect when serving party drinks to your guest. Instead of serving a Rum Collins in a Collins glass, try using a tall pilsener beer glass or a big wine goblet. Those oversize brandy snifters that are used only occasionally will give an aura of importance to any tall drink. Footed iced-tea glasses, parfait, and sherbet glasses, and tall water goblets, can add just the right tough to cocktails and coolers.</description>

			<tip_number>No. 11: Exotic Fruits</tip_number>
			<description>Time was that tropical fruits in most of the U.S. were limited to oranges, lemons, grapefruits, limes, bananas, pineapples, and coconuts (the latter, not really a fruit but a seed, is included here because it is a popular mixed-drink ingredient). Thanks to jet transportation, increased demand for exotic tropical fruits, and important technological improvements in food precessing, new kinds of tropical fruits are becoming available. Sweet, syrupy papaya, mango and guava nectars are the professional bartender and the home drink maker. These are now becoming available in supermarkets. Rare tropical fruits like the soursop, sweetsop, custard apple, mammee apple, akee, and Malay apple will no doubt find their way to grocery-store shelves. It wansnt lon gago that the kiwi, passion fruits become readily available, mixologists will have a field day and the rum drinker will be the beneficiary.</description>

			<tip_number>No. 12: Coconut Control</tip_number>
			<description>Fresh ripe coconuts are troublesome to prepare, but worth it in terms of flavor dividends for both food and drink preparation. When buying a coconut, select one that is heavy in the hand and full of liquid which can be heard when the coconut is shaken. First puncture the "eyes" at one end of the shell with an ice pick and drain out liquid. It may be frozen or kept in the refrigerator for a day or two. If you wish to use the shell as a container, saw it in half and remove coconut meat by inserting a long, thin, flexible kitchen knife in between shell and meat and pry out. Remove brown skin with a vegetable parer and shred with a grater or chop in a blender by adding just a few pieces at a time. Some cooks find it easier to open the shell and extract the meat by baking the whole coconut in an oven for about 15 minutes at 325 degrees. The shell is easer to crack open. If you wish to make coconut milk, chop meat in blender with about 1/4 cup of water for a small coconut. Use milk in place of water for coconut cream. Add the liquid you drained from the coconut for more intense flavor. Strain mixture and use for drink-making. If more liquid is needed, return coconut meat to blender and repeat the process.</description>

			<description>Spills happen under the best of sircumstances. Fast action can often prevent permenant damage to a dress or suit. Red wine stains are particularly stubborn. The affcted area should be bathed with club soda or cold water immediately, followed by liquid detergent or mild bar soap (Ivory), which is rubbed into stain. The same treatment should be used on coffee stains. Club soda is a handy, inexpensive grease-cutter that some bartenders use to clean wood and stainless-steel surfaces as well as spots from their customers' jackets adn ties.</description>

			<tip_number>No. 14: Flavor Catalysts</tip_number>
			<description>The flavor enhancement of rum-based fruit drinks, as well as those made with other spirits such as gin and vodka, can be effectively accomplished by the use of fruit-flavored liqueurs. Accomplished mixologist use these complex and comparatively expensive formulations as elegant sweeteners, as aromatic floats on top of drinks, as a foil or flavor accent to balance or modify another dominant taste, or to create a more interesting flavor in a conventional drink recipe. The new, flavor-intensive schnapps products such as peach, pear, apple, and other fruit, spice, anc candy, and soft drink flavors are excellent for giving old drink recipes a new zest.</description>

			<tip_number>No. 15: Tropical Toppings</tip_number>
			<description>Toppings for exotic, tall coolers and party drinks have been the hallmarks of this kindof refreshment since the practice was begun by establishments such as Trader Vic's and Don the Beachcomber when they wanted to popularize thier so-called Polynesian-type rum drinks in the 1930s. The fact that nobody in Polynesia had ever seen one of these elegant, showcase libations is unimportant. The ingrediants (fruits, spices, and flavorings from faraway places combined with rare rums), the toppings (aromatic liqueurs), and the decorations (hibiscus, orchids, and gardenias) Proclaimed to adoring patrons: "This is what is drunk in a tropical paradise." Toppings will add luster and enjoyment tp almost any drink. trpoical or not. Sometimes a dashm splash, or a teaspoon of spirits sush as brandy or a high-proof rum is used as a float on top of a drink, but more often the choice is a liqueur.</description>

			<tip_number>No. 16: Fresh Ice</tip_number>
			<description>Fresh ice. No, it doesn't refer to freshening someone's glass woth addtitional ice. It is an important consideration, especially for the home bartender. Ice that has been kept for a long time in a freezer not only will take on odors from meats, fish, and vegetables stored nearby but will become stale with the passage pf time. You probably ave experienced the flat, musty taste of water that has been stored for a long period of time in a sealed container or the unpleasant odor from an empty jar that has been closed and stored away in the back of a cupboard.  Old ice can give an off-taste and odor to many mixed drinks, particularly those that require a generous amount of ice in their making. So, do as good hosts and experienced mixologists do: use fresh ice. It's the cheapest ingredient in any drink, so you might as well go first class.</description>

			<tip_number>No. 17: Frosting Glasses</tip_number>
			<description>Frosting glasses, mugs, or tankards is as important to the proper presentation of specual drinks such as the Mint Julep as a pastry chef's ingenious decorations on a layer cake or petit four. To make your drinks look appetizing and crackling cold be sure that the glass or mug is completely dry on the outside, since moisture retards frosting and if the glass is wet enough it won't frost at all. For best results, place dry glasses in freezer for an hour or so beffore using. Metal, such as copper, pewter, or silver frost best and look elegant. A note of caution: Do not hold mug with bare hand. it will melt frost. Use a glove or bar towel.</description>

			<description>The simplest mixer in the world--water--can make or break a drink. Heavily treated or chlorinated tap water will flatten the flavor of premium whiskey faster than you can say, "I'll have another." If you compare your favorite scotch or bourbon with tap water and a good spring water, your taste buds will quickly show you the difference. Ice cubes, made with spring water are also a flavor saver, and they'll look crystal clear in your glass.</description>

			<description>Before putting a load of dirty glasses in the dishwasher, check for lipstickon the rims. A little pre-wash spray helps het rid of these stains, which a home dishwasher cannot always remove completely. Fine crystal should be hand-washed, never put into dishwasher. If washing in hard water, a half ounce of vinegar added to your sink makes your glasses bright and shiny. Dishes and glasses washed by hand should be placed in a rack and allowed to air dry. If your fine lead crystal becomes dusty as a result of infrequent use, never polish with a cloth; it will scartch the glass. They must be washed by hand and air dried.</description>

			<tip_number>No. 20: Simple Sweetener</tip_number>
			<description>Since sugar and alcohol do not readily mix, busy professional bartenders use superfine sugar or simple sugar syrups to speed up the mixing process. A good working formula is two cups sugar to one cup water. Mix sugar with cold water in a saucepan and boil for five minutes or until all sugar is dissolved and the syrup is clear. Cool and bottle. It will last a considerable period of time and save considerable time in drink-making.</description>

			<description>When filling a number of glasses from the same cocktail shaker or blender, don't fill the first glass to the top and then the remaining glasses. You will usually come out short on the last glass unless you are experienced. Experts fill each glass about half full and then return to glass number one and repeat the procedure. This will insure an equal portion for everyone.</description>

Try rubbing the area with a cloth moistened with camphorated oil or turpentine. Some have found that sprinkling salt over the stain and rubbing with a cloth saturated with lemon oil is effective. Or you can flood the area with lemon oil, let stand for a few hours, and wipe off. Prompt action is important. Wood surfaces defaced by old stains must be refinished.</description>

			<description>When making Pousse-Cafés, master bartenders usually pour liquid slowly over the back or round bottom of a barspoon that is held inside the glass very near the previous ingredient that has been poured. A stirring rod may be used in place of a spoon. Other bartenders prefer to pour liquid very slowly down the inside of the glass or down a glass stirring rod. Any agitation or rush of liquid will cause the layers to mix. Patience and adroit spoon-handling cand produce a multi-hued libation fit for an empress.</description>

			<tip_number>No. 26: Room Temperature</tip_number>
			<description>Most wine books tell you to chill white wines and sparkling wines but to serve red wines at room temperature. The "room temperature" generally referred to is that found in Europe. Americans consider 72 degrees to be an acceptable room temperature. In England, 50 degrees is somewhere near the norm. A red wine served at 50 degrees will generally taste more sprightly than the same wine served at 72 degrees. A good sommelier knows that putting a little chill on even a distinguished red wine definitely makes it more palatable.</description>

			<tip_number>No. 27: Sparkle Saver</tip_number>
			<description>Spare the fizz. And if the fizz comes from champagne or other good sparkling wine made by time-honored methode champenois, all the more reason to preserve it. All mixologists should use care when using a sparkling wine in the making of mixed drinks, and especially punches, to stir the mixture gently so as not to dissipate the sparkle. And for the same reason, all swizzle sticks, those destructive devices no doubt invented by die-hard Prohibitionists to tak eht ejoy out of drinking champagne, should be seized and burned or otherwise obliterated. For this reason, a wrning notice should be printer on every sparkling wine label: PLEASE SPARE THE SPARKLE. Don't stir out in minutes what it took months of work by master winemakers to put into this bottle.</description>

			<description>How do you open a bottle of champagne? By removing the wire fastener and foil that covers the crown of every champagne bottle and twisting the cork until it can be pulled out of the bottle. Right? Wrong. Experienced sommeliers and bartenders know that the easy way to open a bottle of champagne is to hold the cork in one hand and turn the bottle with the other. Try it, it works. Place the bottle upright on the bar or table and use a bar towel to get a firm grip on the cork, hold tightly and slowly turn the bottle with your other hand.</description>

			<tip_number>No. 29: Vermouth Preserves</tip_number>
			<description>Vermouth is a popular, complex, aromatized wine with a relatively high alcoholic content that is indispensable to the making of many mixed drinks. If you buy a bottle of either sweet or dry vermouth and let it stand in your liquor cabinet for weeks after it has been opened, you will find the subtle flavor overtones that vermouth can impart to drinks will have disappeared. Store opened bottles of vermouth in your refrigerator. Unless you use a great deal of vermouth, buy the 375 ml bottle instead of the 750 ml size. It takes up less space in the refrigerator and, no doubt, will be used up before it becomes stale.</description>

			<description>Glass, metal, wood, or plastic, it makes no difference. When moisture forms on the outside of a glass and flows down onto the coaster, the coaster sticks to the glassand usually ends up on the floor or your lap. You can easily make the best stick-proof coaster in the world by cutting circles out of carpet swatches or scraps. And gluing them to the conventional coasters. Try it. It really works.</description>

			<tip_number>No. 31: Bar Mixes</tip_number>
			<description>From time to time you will come across recipes that specify so-called bar mixes such as sweet-and-sour and similar lemon-lime combinations containing a sweetener and some times egg white to make a drink with a foamy head. Bar mixes come in powdered as well as liquid versions. They have one great advantage in that they offer an instantly ready drink mix that yields consistent results when making drinks for a large number of people. And, obviously, they fulfill a need when on a camping trip or an extended cruise on a small boat and fresh fruit is not available. For home drink-making, even for fairly large groups, fresh or frozen fruit juces are undeniably the best choice.</description>

			<tip_number>No. 33: Punch Extender</tip_number>
			<description>Some punches, while flavorful, well-balanced, and hearty, like Fish House Punch, are simply too strong for protracted drinking. The solution is obviously to extend or dilute the mixture so the high alcoholic content is spread out over more servings. Instead of disturbing the flavor or balance by adding, say, more fruit juice, experienced bartenders opt for club soda. The sparkle adds to the punch and does not interfere witht he basic recipe. If done with care, this is a practical way to keep your guests from having an abbreviated evening.</description>

			<tip_number>No. 34: Flaming Punches</tip_number>
			<description>When flaming punches in a large container such as a chafing dish, or a heat-proof punch bowl, it is necessary to have a lid handy to extinguish the flames in the container. In the case of a large punch bowl for which no securely fitting lid is available, make a cover using two layers of very heavy institutional aluminum broiling foil that is shaped so it will cover the bowl tightly. In no instance should any punch mixture be flamed for more than a few seconds because it allows too much alcohol to burn away. Make certain a lid is close by before the flaming process begins, since this is the only method for quickly extinguishing the flames in a container without damaging the contents.</description>

			<tip_number>No. 35: Proper Tea</tip_number>
			<description>The making of tea for punches is important. You may get by with a teabag sloshed about in a cup of tepid water when making a cup of "Old Herbal Dreadful" tea for your aunt, but a liter or so of that very same tea can ruin a beautiful punch. Tea in punch is a balancer and a binder. It smooths out the punch and holds the disparate elements together. A strong tea is often called for in punches, but that does not mean bitter and overbrewed. On the other hand, a weak, bland tea does nothing for a punch except dilute it. To make a proper cup of tea, scald out a teapot, add a rounded teaspoon of tea leaves for each cup and fill pot with spring water. Bring to a brisk boil. After three minutes of steeping, and not more than five minutes, stir tea and strain into cups. Remember, when a recipe calls for strong tea, it means fully brewed, but not harsh and bitter from oversteeping.</description>

			<tip_number>No. 36: Taste Testing</tip_number>
			<description>No professional chef or experienced cook would dream of serving a soup, sauce, or other made-from-scratch recipe without tasting it during the course of preparation. All recipes are subject to change and modification depending on the nature of the available ingredients and the taste preferences of the one who is doing the cooking. Complicated punches and other mixed drinks are no different. They must always be checked for flavor before serving and especially for sweetness. If a punch turns out to be too sour or too sweet despite the fact that you have followed the recipe, adjustments should be made until you are satisfied with the results.</description>

			<tip_number>No. 37: Hot Cups</tip_number>
			<description>Serving a hot drink in a cold glass is as bad as serving hot food on a cold plate. Glasses used for hot beverages should be rinsed in hot water so they are thoroughly warmed before serving. The best container for a hot drink is a china cup, or an earthenware mug because it holds the heat longer. When pouring very hot drinks into cups and glasses, be sure to place a spoon in the container to prevent cracking. Silver, pewter, and copper mugs should be used with care in the service of very hot drinks. The excellent heat conductivity of these metallic containers can cause minor burns to the lips and mouth.</description>

			<tip_number>No. 38: Flaming Safety</tip_number>
			<description>What is the beast way to flame drinks? Answer: safely. Alcohol is a flammable substance. When alcohol starts to warm, it begins to vaporize, and this vapor is very flammable. Alcohol used for all flambé food dishes and flaming drinks must be warmed or it will not ignite unless the proof is very high (100 to 151). Professionals always treat alcohol with respect.

			Safety Rules: 
				Do not use large amounts of alcohol to flame drinks. A scant ounce is sufficient.
				When heating spirits in a saucepan or chafing dish, stand well back and do not bend over to look into the pan. 
				When igniting spirits in a brightly lit room, dim the lights. The flames from alcohol are almost invisible in daylight.
				Do not place uncorked bottles of spirits near any open flame.
				Never pour spirits from a bottle into a flaming dish.
				Never flame anything in a large pan or chafing dish with people sitting at the table. Instead, do your flaming on a cart or serving table.
				Never flame anything near draperies, curtains, or in the vicinity of party decorations.</description>

			<tip_number>No. 39: Hot Spirits</tip_number>
			<description>Piping hot drinks are much to be desired, especially when there is a chill in the air. Drinks can be made with boiling hot ingredients as long as they are nonalcoholic. Wines and spirits should never be boiled. Also, many liqueurs and almost all wines do not stand up well to high heat and develop an off flavor. Care should be taken when heating alcoholic ingredients over an open flame. Use small quantities and a low flame. Spirits are volatile materials that can ignite and flare up, causing singed hair and eyelashes, and in some cases minor burns.</description>

			<tip_number>No. 40: Rim Dips</tip_number>
			<description>To give a cocktail added flavor and appetite appeal, you can frost the top of the glass in many interesting ways. Try rimming your glass with zesty fruit juices such as cranberry, grape, pineapple, orange, and grapefruit or syrups such as apple-cinnamon, blueberry, raspberry, strawberry, orgeat, or Falernum. Sweeteners such as orange blossom or buckwheat honey, a good grade of light molasses, chocolate, or corn syrup provide a flavorful base for your dips. Experiment with dips using raw sugar crystals or brown sugar, or crush assorted hard candies into a coarse powder using a mortar and pestle or by wrapping hard candies in a towel and cracking them into tiny pieces with a rolling pin. Whatever you use as a dip, the particles must be small enough to adhere to the moistened rim of the glass.</description>

			<tip_number>No. 41: Fire Spray</tip_number>
			<description>For those who enjoy a pyrotechnical display with their cocktails, lemon, lime, orange, or grapefruit peel squeezed over their drink and instantaneously ignited with a match provides a festive touch. The volatile essential oils in the peel, when released, produce a very fine spray that creates a flash when set afire. When rubbed on the rim of a glass, the peel leaves an often intense residual flavor that many drinkers find appealing. The amount of flame generated is minuscule, so one need not be diffident about flambéeing their apéritif.</description>
