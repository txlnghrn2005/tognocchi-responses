		 	<mixology_terms_name>Apéritif</mixology_terms_name>
		 	<description>Originally a reference to an apéritif wine, fortified and aromatized by the addition of various herbs and spices. The term was also applied to various other wine concoctions such as Dubonnet, Byrrh, St. Raphael, and bitter-based liqueurs like Campari, Amer Picon, and even bitters themselves, such as Fernet Branca. Now the term encompasses pre-prandial spirits such as ouzo, Calisay, Pernod, Ricard, anesone; all kinds of cocktails; and even white table wine. What constitutes an apéritif is of less important than when it is consumed. In other words, an apéritif is anything alcoholic taken prior to dining.</description>
