What do Clark and Anderson say about technologies like XML? How does technology (and XML in particular) fit into their notion of sustainable technical communication?

Clark and Anderson brought to light the problems with technical communication, more specifically, technical communication pre-2005. Their article consistently discussed the narrow focus of technical communicators as it pertains to content management and knowledge management. With regards to the question about technologies like XML, Clark and Anderson suggested to be part of the design process for new technologies. In the section of their paper they discuss how practitioners use user focus studies to address issues. But, often times, these studies are conducted after the product has been made. They stated “Technical communicators are seldom asked to contribute their rhetorical expertise in early system design stages, which might prevent many of the design problems usability tests often reveal.” By getting on the ground floor of new technologies, technical communicators can influence design and correct issues with products before those products ever make it to the market.

Technical communicators should understand how tools affect their work from a business perspective and to expand their understanding of business practices. Most of Clark and Anderson article was centered on changing the focus of technical communicators. The idea is to change from a narrow focus on “technology as tools” to a broader focus of understanding the business side of technology and technical communications, the organizational problems, and audiences instead of just the end user. A change in this mindset helps to establish credibility, and removes the introvert persona of the technical communicator. It forces them to leave their cubicles and become part of the solution to the organizations overall objectives.

Hindsight being 20/20 I had to do a little self-reflection on this article. I had to really think about my role as a technical communicator. What skills did I learn as an undergraduate in technical communication? Did my training provide adequate information to address business objectives outside the classroom? I remember some of my team projects and my role at the time was focused on what tools I knew as a team contributor, but I didn’t understand overall objective of the exercise. I believe that this misunderstanding is what many technical communicators face, once they leave academia. Which is what Clark and Anderson discusses with the narrow focus on tools. So, how does someone change their focus?
