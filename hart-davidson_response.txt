How does Hart-Davidson alter your perspective on a technical communicator's role within an organization?

I fail to see how content management can be compared to air traffic control. Comparing an air traffic controller to a content manager is like comparing apples to oranges. Air traffic controller are only focused on predefined aspect of their job. If he/she is the radar operator, then he/she is concerned with his air space leading up to the airport. If he/she is a “tower flower,” then he/she is concerned with the planes he can physically see. There are several different sections within the scope of air traffic control, but each work independently from one another. At least until they hand off an aircraft to the next section. Their only concern is safety of flight. A content manager, on the other hand, is concerned with big picture ideas, or projects.  They need to have an understanding of every element that goes on in order for the organization to be successful. An airport facility manager would compare well to a content manager. 

Beforehand, I didn’t think of a content manger in the capacity Hart-Davidson mentioned, being able to provide critical insight to ensure success in an organization. I believed it was just another role technical communicators took on, much like being able to code, or know how to use Photoshop. I saw it as a small piece of the overall concept of a technical communicator, when in reality it is the opposite. A content manager has the ability to do everything, or at least control every aspect of content design. It makes sense though, technical communicators working as content managers have to be involved in every facet of an organization’s overall strategy. Content managers need to understand all moving parts that make up the big picture. I don’t believe they have to be experts in every field, but they should have an understanding of each element that contributes to the process. Content manager should be able to quickly identify what is necessary and what isn’t, in order to save time. 

Conversely, content manager ties into our other readings on how a technical communicator can market themselves. Having the ability to run, organize, plan, direct are qualities a technical communicator should be able to do as a content manager. If you are an introvert or extrovert, having the ability to manage the content for an organization from top-to-bottom speaks volumes about your worth to an organization. This especially holds true if you can streamline processes, make things run more efficiently, and save or make the company money.
