		<p style="font-family: Helvetica">Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation also known as XSLT is a language used for transforming XML data. Furthermore, XSLT contains the formatting and logic of a document. This allows for the same stylesheet to be reused with any content. Unlike CSS for HTML, XSLT tags are created by the user. Tags are created from the XML document and transformed into a predefined template. The data contained within the XML is not changed; however, XSLT can take XML and convert it to multiple formats. In essence, XSLT allows the document designer to develop HTML, PDF, and any other content from a single source.</p>

		<h2 style="font-family: Helvetica; text-align:left; font-size:18pt; color:A16832">How is XSLT useful for technical communicators?</h2>
		<p style="font-family: Helvetica">XSLT is useful for technical communicators as a single-source document development tool. XSLT can save technical communicators time developing content for multiple outputs. XSLT for XML acts like CSS for HTML on crack. CSS is used to define the styles of tags within HTML; however, XSLT does the same for XML with a few extra attributes. If a technical writer understands just the basic information of XSLT, he/she can manipulate it to produce multiple outputs of the XML data. If the content has a large volume of information, i.e. a parts catalog, XSLT can be used to generate charts and graphs of the content, or a webpage (or website) for specific content, or even a PDF for parts. XSLT is the ideal single-source tool a technical writer can possess. If a technical writer wanted to produce that same content without XSLT, they would have to create each element individually, then cross-reference them together. A single XSLT file can be used output XHTML, PDF, vectors and graphs, and other content, whereas, HTML would require multiple pages for each bit of information, a PDF would require a different program for development, as would vectors and graphs. XSLT saves technical communicators time as they can develop templates to use over and over again </p>
		
		<p style="font-family: Helvetica">In a nutshell, XSLT would be a great tool for technical writer to know. XSLT is a great resource to know for single-source information. Technical writers using XSLT for their project can save time and give it style!</p>
